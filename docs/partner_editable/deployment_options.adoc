This Quick Start provides six deployment options (three scenarios with two options each):

* Scenario 1:
** *Deploy and manage your own AD DS installation in a new VPC*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-short-name} into this new VPC.
** *Deploy and manage your own AD DS installation in an existing VPC*. This option provisions {partner-product-short-name} in your existing AWS infrastructure.
* Scenario 2:
** *Extend your on-premises AD into a new VPC*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys two Windows EC2 instances into this new VPC.
** *Extend your on-premises AD into an existing VPC*. This option provisions two Windows EC2 instances in your existing AWS infrastructure.
* Scenario 3:
** *Deploy AD DS with AWS Directory Service on AWS in a new VPC*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys AWS Managed Microsoft AD into this new VPC.
** *Deploy AD DS with AWS Directory Service on AWS in an existing VPC*. This option provisions AWS Managed Microsoft AD in your existing AWS infrastructure.

The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. You can configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and {partner-product-short-name} settings, as discussed later in this guide.
