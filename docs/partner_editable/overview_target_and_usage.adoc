This Quick Start reference deployment guide discusses architectural considerations and configuration steps for deploying a highly available Microsoft Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) environment on the AWS Cloud. It also provides links for viewing and launching http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/[AWS CloudFormation^] templates that automate the deployment.

The guide is for IT infrastructure architects and administrators who want to design and deploy a solution to launch AD DS in the AWS Cloud, or extend their on-premises AD DS into the AWS Cloud.
